# Contributing Scrapers
Scrapers make up, line for line, most of PDAP. Here's the [official documentation](https://docs.pdap.io/data-collection/write-a-data-scraper).

## What do the scrapers do?
Navigate to a source of public police data, convert it to a unified format, and add it to our version-controlled database.

## Best practices
At least one approval is required for any Pull Requests to be merged.

## Approving Scrapers
Anyone is welcome to approve scrapers. Your approval means you think the scraper is legal. Style suggestions are welcome, but the reality is that we're aiming at a moving target: a working scraper can be broken at any moment by changes made in a jurisdiction. Approve legal scrapers.

* Review the scraper for legal risk. This is the most important approval criteria.
* Does the sample data look sane and accurate? Is it legal? If so, approve it!
* Make a comment if you have style or scale suggestions. Better, share your skills by making a PR to improve the work of someone else!
