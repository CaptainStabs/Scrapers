# Police Data Accessibility Project Scrapers

This repo contains the record scrapers (and associated tooling) to further the goals of the Police Data Accessibility Project.

## Structure

There are going to be a lot of scrapers. Try to stick to the format of `$STATE/$COUNTY/$RECORD_TYPE`. If there are state-level records being scraped, something like `$STATE/state/$RECORD_TYPE` is fine. Please avoid dashes and spaces in directory names.

## Note Regarding Captcha
The Police Data Accessibility Project does not condone the usage of code or methods that bypasses captchas - especially when used in violation of a website's or organization's Terms of Service. We have removed code from this repository that could be used to for that purpose in furtherence of adhering to our core values.
